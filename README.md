# ChromaGolang
Start of a wrapper API of Razer Chroma for Golang. Based on https://github.com/chroma-sdk/chroma-python.

## Disclaimer
This project is being developed based on personal needs. It's to go away from subprocess calling python3 every time I want new color to run. Will be turned into a package soonish. 

## Current state
* Keyboard static on(with color)/off only.

## Needed
* Tests (Not/as examples)
* Color conversion
* Enums
* Gridlayouts
